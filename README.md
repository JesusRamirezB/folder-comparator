# Folder Comparator

Folder Comparator is a web-based tool that allows you to compare the contents of two folders to ensure that all files are present and identical. It checks the filenames and file contents, ignoring the folder structure, and provides a visual indication of whether all files match between the two folders.

## Features

- **Compare Folders**: Upload two folders and compare their contents.
- **File-by-File Comparison**: Ensures that all files in the source and destination folders are identical.
- **Visual Feedback**: Displays "Passed" in green if all files are identical, or "Failed" in red if there are any discrepancies. Each file is also color-coded based on whether it matches.

## How to Use

1. **Upload Folders**: Use the file input fields to select the source and destination folders. The folders should contain the files you want to compare.
2. **Compare Folders**: Click the "Compare Folders" button to start the comparison process.
3. **View Results**: After the comparison, results will be displayed, showing whether the folders are identical and the status of each file.

## Installation

To run the Folder Comparator locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
